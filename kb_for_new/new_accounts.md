# Requesting a new CenturyLink Azure Account:





# Internal Teams
Any CenturyLink department needing an Azure account set up in our CSP at the discounts Microsoft allows us can send a request to the Cloud Integration team (cloudintegration@ctl.io). We will need:
A name for your “customer” account that distinguishes it from all the other CTL accounts
A CTL cost code to add to the name of your account so that we can immediately begin proper chargeback for usage
The name and email of your first administrative user that we will hand the keys to the account over to and discuss how to set up other users and permissions.
