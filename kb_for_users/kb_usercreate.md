1. The _______@[yourdomain}.onmicrosoft.com user you create for them will be able log into portal.azure.com but they cannot do anything until they are added to a subscription. For efficiencyâ€™s sake, we suggest you do that for multiple users all at once.


1. To add a user to a subscription, navigate to https://portal.azure.com as your admin user, and find subscriptions (The key icon).

* For the time being, we expect you to be giving everyone either Owner or Contributor roles.
* Once you have selected the role, you can begin locating and adding all the users you created into that role. 

Now that you have a Microsoft Azure account you can manage it directectly from portal.azure.com or [use Microsoft Azure with Elasticbox](https://github.com/amwatson1s/kb/blob/master/kb_for_elasticbox/KB%20for%20Azure%20CSP%20and%20Elasticbox.md).
